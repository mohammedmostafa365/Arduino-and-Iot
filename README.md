# 🚀 Arduino Projects – Level 1 & Level 2

Welcome to my **Arduino Learning Journey**, where I built and tested multiple projects during my studies in the **Electrical Engineering Department at Kafr El-Sheikh University**.  
This repository contains two levels of Arduino projects, starting from basic sensor circuits to more advanced IoT and communication systems.

## 🧩 Level 1 – Basic Arduino Projects

This level focuses on understanding fundamental sensors, electronic components, and how they interact with the Arduino board.  
Each project helps you understand input/output, control, and automation basics.

### 🔧 Projects List

| No. | Project Name | Description |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Ultrasonic Sensor** | Measures distance using sound waves. |
| 2 | **IR Sensor** | Detects objects or obstacles based on infrared reflection. |
| 3 | **LDR Sensor** | Detects light intensity and brightness changes. |
| 4 | **Flame Sensor** | Detects fire or flame presence. |
| 5 | **Relay Module** | Controls high-voltage devices using Arduino. |
| 6 | **Push Button** | Basic digital input example to trigger actions. |
| 7 | **Obstacle Avoidance Car** | Smart car that avoids obstacles automatically using sensors. |
| 8 | **Bluetooth Car** | A remote-controlled car using Bluetooth communication. |
| 9 | **Keypad Car** | A car controlled using a keypad interface. |

## 🌐 Level 2 – IoT & Advanced Arduino Projects

This level introduces **IoT (Internet of Things)** and communication concepts such as GSM and Bluetooth Master–Slave setups.  
It also includes projects that integrate mobile app control and more complex motion control systems.

### ⚙️ Projects List

| No. | Project Name | Description |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | **GSM Project** | Control or monitor devices via SMS using GSM communication. |
| 2 | **IoT Project** | Connect Arduino to the Internet for remote monitoring or control. |
| 3 | **Bluetooth Car (Slave & Master)** | Two-Arduino Bluetooth communication system for car control. |
| 4 | **Flutter App Control** | Control Arduino devices using a mobile app built with Flutter. |
| 5 | **Stepper Motor Control** | Precise motion control using a stepper motor and driver. |
| 6 | **Joystick Car** | Control a robotic car using a joystick module. |
